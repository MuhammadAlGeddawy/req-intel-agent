# Engineering Requirements Intelligence Agent

Multi-step LangGraph-based analysis pipeline for engineering requirements, with both a CLI workflow and a FastAPI service for persistent analysis history.

## Overview

This project analyzes requirements documents and produces a structured report covering:

- extracted requirements
- domain classification
- safety relevance
- ASIL suggestions
- inconsistency detection
- traceability gap detection
- audit log output

The repository supports three usage modes:

1. **CLI mode** — run the sample workflow and save a JSON report locally
2. **API mode** — submit documents over HTTP and persist analyses to a SQLite database
3. **Docker mode** — run the API as a containerized service with Docker Compose

---

## Current Features

- LangGraph-powered multi-step requirement analysis
- Console report generation
- JSON report export to `requirements_report.json`
- FastAPI API for submitting analyses
- SQLite-backed persistence for saved analyses
- Simple request helper script in `request.py`
- Local HTML viewer file: `report_viewer.html`
- Docker and Docker Compose support for containerized deployment
- Non-root container user for security
- Healthcheck endpoint for container orchestration

## What the Agent Produces

The analysis pipeline builds a report with sections such as:

- metadata
- summary
- inconsistencies
- traceability gaps
- safety assessments
- audit log

Typical outputs include:

- conflicting requirement ranges or constraints
- missing traceability or validation links
- suggested ASIL classifications for safety-related items
- timestamped LLM-call audit data

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (for local development)
- OpenRouter API key or compatible LLM configuration expected by the project
- Internet access for model calls if using hosted LLMs
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:

- `langgraph`
- `langchain`
- `langchain-core`
- `pydantic`
- `openai`
- `python-dotenv`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn[standard]`

---

## Setup

### Local Development

From the `req_intel_agent` directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `config/.env` with your local settings. At minimum, configure the API key your LLM client expects. You can copy the example file:

```bash
cp config/.env.example config/.env
```

Example:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./requirements_agent.db
```

Notes:

- `config/.env` is intentionally ignored by git
- if `DATABASE_URL` is not set, the app defaults to SQLite at:
  `requirements_agent.db`
- that SQLite file is typically created in the `req_intel_agent` directory when the API runs from there

### Docker Setup

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. The provided `docker-compose.yaml` expects a `config/.env` file:

```bash
cp config/.env.example config/.env
# Edit config/.env and add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

Then build and run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## Running the CLI Workflow

The CLI mode uses `sample_requirements.txt`, runs the LangGraph pipeline, prints a formatted report, and writes the full JSON output to `requirements_report.json`.

From the `req_intel_agent` directory:

```bash
python run.py
```

Alternative:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

Generated file:

```text
requirements_report.json
```

---

## Running the API

### Locally

Start the FastAPI app from the `req_intel_agent` directory:

```bash
uvicorn src.api:app --reload
```

The API initializes the database on startup.

Default local URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### With Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This mounts a persistent volume (`agent-data`) for the SQLite database and exposes port `8000`.

### Available Endpoints

#### `GET /health`

Basic health check.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

#### `POST /analyze`

Submit a requirements document for analysis and persistence.

Request body:

```json
{
  "document": "REQ-SYS-001 ...",
  "document_name": "my_requirements.txt"
}
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "analysis_id": 1,
  "report": {}
}
```

#### `GET /analyses`

Returns saved analysis summaries ordered by newest first.

#### `GET /analyses/{analysis_id}`

Returns a single saved analysis, including:

- document name
- raw document
- report
- creation timestamp

---

## Example API Usage

### Using `curl`

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"document":"REQ-SYS-001 The system shall...","document_name":"example.txt"}'
```

### Using the included script

The repository includes `request.py`, which reads `sample_requirements.txt` and posts it to the local API:

```bash
python request.py
```

Note: `request.py` uses the `requests` package. If it is not already installed in your environment, install it manually:

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## Database Storage

The persistence layer is implemented in `src/db.py` using SQLAlchemy.

Stored table:

- `analysis_records`

Stored fields:

- `id`
- `document_name`
- `raw_document`
- `report`
- `created_at`

Default database location (local development):

```text
requirements_agent.db
```

Default connection string:

```text
sqlite:///./requirements_agent.db
```

When running with Docker Compose, the database is persisted in a named volume at:

```text
/app/data/requirements_agent.db
```

You can override this by setting `DATABASE_URL` in `config/.env`.

---

## Sample Output

When running the CLI flow against `sample_requirements.txt`, the project can detect issues such as:

- requirement inconsistencies across domains
- traceability gaps
- safety-relevant items requiring human review
- structured audit information for model interactions

The full JSON output is saved to:

```text
requirements_report.json
```

---

## Important Notes

- Safety / ASIL output is advisory and requires human review
- `config/.env` should never be committed
- local cache files and runtime artifacts are ignored by git
- the local SQLite database file is also ignored by git
- the Docker image runs as a non-root user (`appuser`) for security

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangGraph**
- **LangChain**
- **FastAPI**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **Pydantic**
- **SQLite**
- **python-dotenv**
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**

## Next Improvements

Potential next steps for the project:

- add Swagger/OpenAPI usage examples to the README
- add automated tests for API routes and DB persistence
- add a richer frontend for browsing saved analyses
- add authentication if the API is exposed beyond local development
- add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and image publishing
